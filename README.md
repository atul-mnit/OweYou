Notes
-----------------------------
1. In "Add Expenditure", the entries are first recorded into a Temporary Database.
   If the given entries are valid(i.e All the Expenditure Balance(Paid-Consumed) sum up to 0), then only it is updated
   into Main Database. Otherwise "Incorrect Inputs(Total Not 0)" error message is flashed.
2. In "Settle Up", once you click on Settle Up, all the settlement details are shown. And once you have done all the settlements
   (i.e paid or recieved money from whom so ever), Database is updated to contain a balance of "0" for all names.
